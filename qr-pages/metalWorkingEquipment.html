    <p>In this video, there are 4 machines that can be easily seen. There are two Lathes, one Shaper and an industrial radial drill. In a factory, these, machiners would run off the same motor like they are now, using a gear and belt system to speed up or slow down a machine without having to slow the input. This allows for the input to run at a consistant speed without running the machines too fast for the users to use effectively. </br>Traditionally, these machines would be used for different purposes, with the radial drill was a revolutionary piece of equipment that was used to make drilling easier on the user, by allowing them to move the drill head from side to side instead of having to move the entire object they were drilling into. These objects would weigh up to 3 tons, so the ability to move the drill instead of the object made drilling much easier and simpler in an industrial process. The drill allowed the user to move the drill head left and right by using a series of gears, making precise moves of the drill head possible. </br>The Shaper was a tool used to ensure a piece of metal going through the machine was cut to the correct size, and ensure that it is complete flat and even. Without this, a piece of metal going through the machining process may need to be hand worked multiple times to flatten it out before use. </br>The Lathe was used to cut cylindrical shapes out of a piece of metal, by spinning the metal piece at high speeds, and carefully shaving it down to the desired shape. There are two Lathes in the video, however they both do the same job.</p>
