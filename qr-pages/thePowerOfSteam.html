    <p>After the water wheel, steam engines started to become more popular for their power. This page displays a various amount of steam engines that were used throughout england during the 18th century. </br>This machine was one of the very first steam engines made, and was used to power a water pump early on due to its lack of enough power to drive more powerful machinery. This specific machine was used in Edinburgh, and is speculated to have been constructed by a company based in Sowerby Bridge, however this cannot be verified.</p>

    <p>This next steam engine was powerful enough to run machinery, and was much larger than the previous machine. This machine was believed to have powered a 5 story mill due to the 5 grooves on the flywheel located at the back of the engine that would pull several ropes going to each floor of the building. </br>Every steam engine had a mechanism on it called a Govenor, which would spin some metal ballbearings around at high speed in order to create a cetripetal (outwarsds) force to adjust a valve on the machine which controls the throttle in order to ensure that the machine stayed at a constant speed at all times.</p>
