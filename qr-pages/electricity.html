    <p>Steam engines unfortunately were not fast or powerful enough to generate electricity. Therefore a machine called a Compound Engine had to be created to generate the kind of speed required for electricity. <br>This was done by using a steam powered piston to power a second piston, which added the second 'kick' required to get the engine up to a fast enough speed to generate electricity. The way it does this is by using aformentioned pistons to spin a shaft at high speeds which was connected to a generator. This generator used magnets and copper coils to generate electricity, and this style of generator technology is what powers electronics today, however it has been vastly improved upon.</p>
