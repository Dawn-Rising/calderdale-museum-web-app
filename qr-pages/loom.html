    <p>This loom was once used to create large tapestries and rugs, this machine itself is still operational and can create multiple patterns, and is also the fastest loom in the musuem. These looms were used a lot back in the 18th century, and a much more updated design of the loom is still in use today. This uses a primitive pre-binary system that was originally invented by the textile industry that holds hooks in place using cards in order to create patterns on the carpet or tapestry being created. A secondary machine called a Jacquard lifts some of the threads based on this card to create the pattern. <br> When in use, this system can also use wired to create loops in the fabric and create a 3D pattern. These were often used for bus seats, train seats and car seats, and used wool before nylon was invented. <br>There are also four machines called Creels that carry 8 rows of 'frames' of bobbins, which allow up to 8 colours to be woven into a design.</p>
