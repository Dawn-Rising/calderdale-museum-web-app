    <p>These machines are circular knitting machines that use a latch-needle to knit the socks with a slot, the cottom moves around them on a track that pulls the thread through the machine. The thread works in a specific way with the needles, the needle pulling a thread down, then moving back up to catch another thread, and pull that down into a loop with the original thread. This was all cranked by hand in workshops, and at first, the heel of the sock had to be created afterwards. Eventually the heel was intergrated into the development to make it much easier and more efficient. Eventually, this crancked mechanism became fully automatic, and made this process even faster.</p>
