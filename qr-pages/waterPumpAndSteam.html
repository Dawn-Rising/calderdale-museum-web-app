    <p>Both made by the same company, these pieces of equipment were used for very different purposes. </br>The water pump was used to pump water out of a mine at high speed using a powered input, it converts linear motion into lateral motion via the use of pistons, which moved up and down while the main shaft spun at high speed. </br>The Gas Engine was produced to introduce power to the main machines, such as the water pump, and would be key to an industry. </br>It was common for companies to produce multiple different types of equipment in order to expand their market, so it was quite common to see an engine powering machinery of the same branding.</p>
